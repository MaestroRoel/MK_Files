Hello Survivors & Bandits of Mercykillers!
Mercykillers has been running a successful series of servers for a while now, and we are constantly expanding
to have more servers for you to play on!
We just recently got our very own dedicated server, so we can manage and control the servers ourselves, to give
you the best possible playing experience with nearly lag-free servers, and admins constantly watching to keep you safe!

But as you may know, keeping all these servers running is not free. 
So, we have decided to make a donator system on our servers.
If you donate to help keep the servers going, we will reward you!
As a Thank You for your donation, we will let you choose your loadout you get with every respawn, 
And you will be considered as a VIP on all our servers, including teamspeak.
